# SCANNING

I used nmap to run a scan to check for opened ports and i saw just one port opened.

I did further scanning on this to see if there was anything and yes i got something(it was not really helpful tho)

# ENUMERATION

I pasted the ip in my browser and it gave me a page, a FUEL CMS page. I tried moving round but there was nothing, Using the image of the second scan with nmap, i still use coconut head to check robots.txr and still nothing too. I did a directory fuzzing
and i got a number of directories.

I navigated to the directories but there was nothing also so I checked the ```/fuel``` directory i saw from the nmap scan, it brought a login page and i entered admin admin as login and pass as it was shown there.

Checked round after logging in but nothing still so i decided to check online if there was any exploit on the version of the fuel cms. I used searchsploit for that.

# EXPLOITATION

After finding the exploit, I saved it to it to my machine/

I ran the first one against the url. 

PS: I changed the name before running it. For some reasons, it kept giving an error which i did not understand so I used the third exploit and it gave a shell.

From here i needed to change it to a reverse shell so i can work better on my terminal. I used an online reverse shell generator to get the commands to use as both the listener and the attacker to get a reverse shell.

After trying different commands and not getting any shell, I later eventually used mkfifo alongside a listener on port 80 which gave me a shell...

From here, i proceed to make the shell stable and stop being dumn with ```python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'```

Moving round the files starting from home and checking the user files landed us in the directory where flag.txt was located. This, my people, is how we get user.txt flag

Now we need to get the root flag which will lead us to privilage ecalation

# PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

After going front and back multiple times, I did not know what to do again to find root flag, all i knew was that i needed a password to be logged in as root. Since i knew this was a linux machine. I was so pissed, I used linpeas. I went to seek the help of pentestmonkey for the script, hosted a python server and wget it into the shell.

We make it executable and then run it to see if there are any vulnerabilities we could not find. While analyzing the result of the linpeas that was ran, we saw something intersting...

Looks like we found the password to login as to root and get our root flag. Let's have it.
